## Instructions

This is my memory game project for the Udacity FEND, which uses vanilla Javascript, CSS, and (of course) HTML to create a classic memory game.

Please clone and Open - "index.html" in your favorite browser.

Once a card is clicked, it will reveal the symbol hidden beneath. Once a symbol is matched, it will stay open. The goal is to match each card with it's sibling until all cards are revealed.

Enjoy!
