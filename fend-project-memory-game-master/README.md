## Instructions

This is my memory game project for the Udacity FEND, which uses vanilla Javascript, CSS, and (of course) HTML to create a classic memory cards game.

Please clone and Open - "index.html" in your favorite browser.

Once a card is clicked, it will reveal the symbol hidden beneath. Once a symbol is matched, it will stay open. The goal is to match each card with it's sibling until all cards are revealed.

Enjoy!

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
